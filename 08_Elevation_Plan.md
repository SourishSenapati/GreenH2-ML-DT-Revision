# Elevation Plan: Targeting Nature Energy / Top-Tier Journals

**Objective:** Transform the manuscript into a breakthrough contribution with global impact, real-world validation, and flawless execution.

## Phase 1: Immediate Fixes (Current Focus)

1. **Verify and Upgrade References:**
   * [ ] Re-verify Moon et al. (2025).
   * [ ] Search for "Kim et al. (2024)" in Chem Eng J and Nature Rev Chem articles.
   * [ ] Add 10+ high-impact 2024-2025 citations.
   * [ ] *Artifact:* Updated `REFERENCES_MASTER.md`.

2. **Incorporate Real Data:**
   * [ ] Search for NREL PEM electrolysis datasets (operational logs).
   * [ ] Integrate real data into `main_simulation.py` (blend with synthetic).
   * [ ] *Artifact:* Updated Code and "Data Integration" section in manuscript.

3. **Detail Methods & Reproducibility:**
   * [ ] Explicitly state hyperparameters in `main_simulation.py` (GBR: n=200, lr=0.1; LSTM: layers=2, units=50).
   * [ ] Implement 10-fold CV with error bars.
   * [ ] *Artifact:* Updated Methods section and Code.

4. **Rewrite Thesis and Claims:**
   * [ ] Formulate falsifiable thesis: "ML-digital twin extends lifespan by 25% and reduces LCOH to $1.5/kg".
   * [ ] Quantify claims in Abstract and Introduction.
   * [ ] *Artifact:* Revised `01_Introduction.md` and `FINAL_MANUSCRIPT.md`.

5. **Redesign Figures:**
   * [ ] Generate minimalist, publication-quality plots (matplotlib).
   * [ ] Add error bars and colorblind-safe palettes.
   * [ ] *Artifact:* New PNGs in `03_Figures`.

## Phase 2: Enhance Novelty (Next Steps)

(To be executed after Phase 1)

* Experimental Validation logic (or simulation backup).
* Expanded Lit Review.
* Impact/Policy Hooks.

## Phase 3 & 4: Validation & Submission

* Internal red-teaming.
* Submission to Nature Energy.
