# Originality and AI Compliance Strategy

## 1. Zero-Plagiarism Mandate

To ensure the manuscript passes strict academic plagiarism checks (Turnitin/iThenticate <15% similarity):

*   **Self-Audit:** Run the final draft through a checker before submission (e.g., Grammarly Premium or Scribbr).
*   **Paraphrasing:** Rewrite all Literature Review summaries in your own voice. avoid "chunking" citations.
    *   *Bad:* "Moon et al. (2025) found that..." (repeatedly).
    *   *Good:* "Recent dual-stack optimizations have demonstrated significant kinetic improvements [1]."
*   **Unique Figures:** All diagrams (schematics, plots) must be 100% original, generated by your Python scripts or drawn from scratch in tools like BioRender/Inkscape. Do not copy-paste from papers.

## 2. AI Detection Mitigation (The "Human Touch")

To differentiate from AI-generated text and pass detectors (ZeroGPT, Turnitin AI):

*   **Specifics over Generics:** Replace vague AI phrases ("It is important to note," "In the comprehensive landscape") with hard data ("Our invalidation study of 200 operational hours shows...").
*   **First-Person Voice:** Use "We developed," "Our analysis reveals" instead of passive voice ("It was found that").
*   **Nuance and Limitation:** AI rarely critiques its own potential failures well. Explicitly discuss *where* your model fails (e.g., "The LSTM struggles with transient startup noise <50ms").
*   **Variable Sentence Structure:** Mix very short, punchy sentences with longer, complex technical descriptions. AI tends toward uniform sentence length.

## 3. Checklist for Final Review

*   Similarity Score < 15% (excluding references).
*   No "AI Hallucinated" citations (All References Verified).
*   Figures are original vector graphics/Python plots.
*   Tone is authoritative and specific, not generic.
