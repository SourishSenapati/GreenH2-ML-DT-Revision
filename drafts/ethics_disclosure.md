# Ethics and Conflicts Statement

No external funding was received for this study (self-funded via Jadavpur University resources). The author has no financial conflicts of interest. Simulations are scoped to PEM/AEM electrolyzers under steady-state assumptions, potentially biasing toward optimistic LCOH projections (e.g., 20-25% life extension assumes Gaussian noise; real variability like Poisson-distributed faults could reduce gains by 10-15%). India-centric framing in Section 3.5 (NGHM implications) reflects author's affiliation but is independent of policy influence—global applicability shown via EU H2 Strategy parallels. All data/models are synthetic/real-blended with provenance logged; no human subjects, so no IRB approval needed. Risks: ML over-reliance could delay human oversight in faults—mitigated by rule-based controls. Future work will include diverse datasets to address underrepresented alkaline systems.
