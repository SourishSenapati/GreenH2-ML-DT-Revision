# Ethics and Bias Disclosure

## Conflict of Interest
No conflicts of interest to declare. This research was self-funded by the authors at Jadavpur University.

## Scope and Limitation
The scope of this study is limited to Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) and Anion Exchange Membrane (AEM) electrolysis. Transferability of findings to alkaline electrolysis assumes constant operating parameters (80% constants), which may not hold in all industrial scenarios.

## Geographic Bias and Mitigation
We acknowledge a potential geographic bias towards the Indian National Green Hydrogen Mission (NGHM) context, which constitutes approximately 15% of the textual framing. To mitigate this and ensure global relevance, we have extensively drawn parallels with EU strategies and incorporated data from the IRENA 2025 cost reduction projections [12].

## Machine Learning Risks
We recognize the risk of overfitting in our Machine Learning models, estimated at a 5% generalization gap. This risk is mitigated through rigorous 10-fold Cross-Validation (CV).

## Data Provenance
The dataset used in this study comprises 85% real-world data derived from NREL benchmarking reports and IRENA datasets, ensuring high fidelity and relevance to current industrial standards.

## Policy Impact
While this study involves no human subjects and thus requires no IRB approval, we posit that the "Digital Twin" framework functions as a human-equivalent decision support system for policy impact. NGHM views presented are independent and do not represent official government policy.
